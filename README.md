What is Machine Learning (ML) ?

Answer: Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that anyone provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn or calculate automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

There are three important libraries for Machine Learning. They are:
                                      
                                      i) numpy
                                      
                                     ii) pandas
                                     
                                    iii) matplotlib.pyplot
                                    
i) Numpy : import numpy as np

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 

Machine Learning total system is all about developing mathematical model. Everything is about mathematics in Machine Learning. 

ii) pandas: import pandas as pd

pandas is for importing dataset. This library is most important and the best one for importing dataset in Machine Learning. Without dataset Machine Learing cann't be started. So, dataset always needs to be imported while doing any project. Thats why this library is so important.

iii) matplotlib.pyplot: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

matplotlib is a library and pyplot is a sub-library of matplotlib. This library is needed for ploting any graphical representation.
