What is Machine Learning (ML) ?

Answer: Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that anyone provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn or calculate automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

There are three important libraries for Machine Learning. They are:
                                      
                                      i) numpy
                                      
                                     ii) pandas
                                     
                                    iii) matplotlib.pyplot
                                    
i) Numpy : import numpy as np
