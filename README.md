## What is Machine Learning (ML) ?

Answer: Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that anyone provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn or calculate automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

There are three important libraries for Machine Learning. They are:
                                      
                                      i) numpy
                                      
                                     ii) pandas
                                     
                                    iii) matplotlib.pyplot
                                    
i) Numpy : import numpy as np

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 

Machine Learning total system is all about developing mathematical model. Everything is about mathematics in Machine Learning. 

ii) pandas: import pandas as pd

pandas is for importing dataset. This library is most important and the best one for importing dataset in Machine Learning. Without dataset Machine Learing cann't be started. So, dataset always needs to be imported while doing any project. Thats why this library is so important.

iii) matplotlib.pyplot: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

matplotlib is a library and pyplot is a sub-library of matplotlib. This library is needed for ploting any graphical representation.

## What is Regression?

Answer: Regression is a model value based on independent predictors. This method is used for forecasting and finding out effect relationships between variables. Regression techniques are based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables. There are two variables. Ther are:

                                           a) X - independent variable and
                                           b) y - dependant variable

## 1. Linear Regression: 

Linear regression is called as simple linear regression. Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. Equation for simple linear regression:

                                      y = b_0 + b_1 * x
                                      
Here, x is Independent variable and y is Dependent variable. In linear regression there will be always one Independent variable.

b_0 and b_1 are called as co-efficient. Co-efficient create relationship between Independent and Dependent variable.

The motive of the linear regression algorithm is to find the best values for b_0 and b_1. 

## 2. Multiple Linear regression: 

Equation for multiple linear regression:

                            y = b_0 + b_1 * x_1 +  b_2 * x_2 + ....... + b_n * x_n
                            
Here, x_1, x_2, ....., x_n are Independent variables and y is Dependent variable. In multiple linear regression there will be always multiple Independent variables.        

b_0, b_1, ..... , b_n are called as co-efficient. Co-efficient create relationship between Independent and Dependent variable.

## 3. Polynomial Regression:

Polynomial regression is a special case of linear regression. We can get good fit line on the data for linear regression. But considering real world examples the data might not be so linearly but more scattered. In such cases linear regression might not be the best way to describe the data. A curved or non linear line might be a better fit for such data.

Equation for polynomial regression:

                           y = b_0 + b_1 * x +  b_2 * x^2 + b_3 * x^3 + ....... + b_n * x^n

Here n is the degree of the polynomial, x are Independent variables and y is Dependent variable.
